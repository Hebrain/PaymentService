# PaymentService

Study project where the application simulates a brief payment routine and works entirely in memory, without a database. 
With the separation of contexts, concepts of CQRS, clean code and SOLID were applied, avoiding the practice of primitive obsession, validations via contract. The construction of 
rich domains was essential for the application of everything mentioned above, because I believe that this way we can have a cleaner, scalable and easier to maintain application.
